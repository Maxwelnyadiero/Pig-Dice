## Behavior Driven Development:
The two parties are to agree on who should go first,that is the opponents.after coming into conclusion,the firstparty starts the game by rolling the dice,the number of times the dice rolls is equivalent to the number of points by which he or she will achieve.but when the die only roll once all the points by which he had managed to achieve are all destroyed,hence the second party takes on to the game,the second party also begins the game and all conditions remains the same,the first party to reach the winning point becomes the winner of the game..
